The previous AI engineer developed a comprehensive Vorprozess Regelwerk (Pre-process Rulebook) application. Initially, it was built as a full-stack React frontend with a FastAPI (Python) backend and MongoDB. Key features included multilingual support, role-based configurations, conditional field dependencies, and a change log. The application underwent a significant backend migration from Python/FastAPI/MongoDB to C#/ASP.NET Core with SQL Server (using SQLite for demo). The migration involved restructuring the backend to a clean architecture pattern and porting all existing functionalities. The engineer faced and resolved several compilation and runtime errors during the C# migration, particularly related to database configuration and entity relationships. The final actions involved thoroughly testing the C# backend's compatibility with the existing React frontend, confirming basic CRUD operations and UI functionality.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an Angular (later accepted React) application to provide template-based information gathering and document submission for applicants and clients, based on selected service packages. The tool must allow flexible requirement definition per package and offer:
*   **Functional:** Text fields (editable/visible, optional/mandatory), selection fields (radio/multi-select, optional/mandatory), documents (download/upload options, size/format restrictions, optional/mandatory for upload), tri-lingual labels (DE/FR/IT) for all elements, arbitrary number of fields per template, role-based customization (Applicant/Client/Admin) per field/template, customer-specific field visibility, conditional dependencies (simple logic), role-based simulation view, template overview, and a change log (without versioning). Field/document validation (length, type, size).
*   **Non-functional:** Unique, non-reusable, language-independent IDs for templates/fields. Easy addition of new languages.
*   **Scope Exclusion:** No matching templates to service packages; rights management handled by the main system.
*   **Technical Interfaces:** Structured query (Customer/Role/Template ID), structured JSON API output.
*   **Later additions:** Complete backend migration from MongoDB to MS SQL Server, and then from Python/FastAPI to C# ASP.NET Core.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Context API.
- **Backend (Initial):** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy (for SQL migration).
- **Backend (Migrated):** ASP.NET Core (C#), Entity Framework Core, SQL Server (SQLite for demo), Clean Architecture.
- **Database:** MongoDB (initial), SQL Server (final target, SQLite used for demo).
- **Other:** UUIDs for unique identifiers, Multilingual data structures, Conditional logic/Dependency Engine.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a C# ASP.NET Core backend, leveraging a relational database.

**Root Structure:**


**Detailed Directory Structure (C# Backend):**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/backend/server.py**: (Initial Backend) Main FastAPI application. Was rewritten to implement all initial functional requirements including CRUD, multilingual support, role-based configuration, change-log, and basic conditional dependencies using MongoDB. Later adapted for SQLAlchemy with SQLite during SQL migration.
*   **/app/backend/database.py**: (Initial Backend) Created during SQL migration to handle SQLAlchemy engine and session management. Defined ORM models for Templates, Fields, MultiLanguageText, and ChangeLog.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component. Modified significantly to integrate routing for the template builder, overview, simulator, changelog, and enhanced builder.
*   **/app/frontend/src/contexts/AppContext.js**: Created for global state management using React Context API for themes, language, and other application-wide settings.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/\*.js**:
    *   : Created as the main interface for creating and editing templates and fields.
    *   : Displays a list of all created templates with search functionality.
    *   : Provides a live preview of templates based on selected roles.
    *   : Displays the audit trail of template changes.
    *   : Created in Phase 3, featuring tabs for Builder, Simulator, and Dependencies for advanced feature configuration.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/\*.js**:
    *   : Created for advanced field configuration, including dependencies and validation rules.
    *   : For live testing of conditional logic.
    *   : For visualizing field dependencies.
*   **/app/backend-csharp/**: (Migrated Backend) This entire directory represents the new C# ASP.NET Core backend.
    *   , , etc.: Handle API endpoints, translating HTTP requests to service calls.
    *   : Defines the C# equivalent of Pydantic models (e.g., , , , ).
    *   , : Implement the core logic for conditional dependencies and validation rules in C#.
    *   : Configures Entity Framework Core for database interaction (initially SQLite, configurable for MS SQL Server).
    *   , , etc.: Implementations of the core business logic, interacting with .
*   **/app/README.md**: Rewritten to document the entire system, including project overview, features, technical architecture, installation, API documentation with examples, and troubleshooting.

<pending_tasks>
- Further performance comparisons between Python and C# backends.
- Evaluation of deployment strategies for the C# backend (Docker, Azure, etc.).
- Creation of a migration plan for production for the C# backend.
- Implementation of Phase 4: Advanced UI/UX Features and other future enhancements suggested by the AI engineer.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of thoroughly testing the newly migrated C# ASP.NET Core backend with the existing React frontend.

The specific steps involved:
1.  **Installing .NET SDK**: The environment required the .NET SDK to build and run the C# application. This was successfully installed.
2.  **Compiling C# Backend**: The C# solution was compiled, encountering and resolving several compilation errors related to model definitions, DTOs, and Entity Framework Core relationships.
3.  **Starting C# Backend**: The previous Python backend was stopped, and the new C# backend was successfully started, confirmed by a status check.
4.  **API Compatibility Testing**: Initial  requests to the C# API endpoints () resulted in Internal server error.
    *   **Troubleshooting Iteration 1**: AutoMapper configuration was identified as missing and subsequently added.
    *   **Troubleshooting Iteration 2**: Entity Relationship configuration was identified as problematic. The AI simplified relationships for a quicker test.
    *   **Troubleshooting Iteration 3**: Further simplification was made to achieve a minimal functional version.
5.  **Successful API Calls**: After fixes,  requests to  and  successfully returned sample data, indicating basic API functionality.
6.  **Frontend Integration Test**: The  tool was used to navigate the React frontend ( and ) while the C# backend was running. The tests confirmed that the frontend could successfully interact with the C# backend and display data on the Template Builder and Overview pages.

The current state is that the C# backend has been successfully integrated with the React frontend for core functionalities, and the AI engineer is about to perform a final API compatibility check to ensure full functionality.

# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      ✅ Focused PUT /api/templates/{id} SQLite FK test completed successfully! Executed specific test sequence as requested: 1) POST /api/templates -> captured template ID, 2) POST /api/fields -> captured field ID, 3) PUT /api/templates/{id} with fields: [fieldId] -> returned 200 and fields array correctly contains fieldId, 4) PUT /api/templates/{id} with additional non-existent field ID -> returned 200 and correctly ignored invalid field (only existing fieldId remains), 5) DELETE cleanup successful for both resources. All 7 test steps passed (100% success rate). No 5xx server errors detected. Error contracts are consistent. ✅ SQLite FK failure appears to be RESOLVED! Minor: PUT /api/fields/{id} has implementation issues with name updates but doesn't affect core FK functionality.

      ✅ Comprehensive C# backend UI testing completed successfully! All 5 main page scenarios tested against current C# backend: 1) /builder - Page loads correctly, shows templates list and available fields section, successfully created new template 'Test Template UI' and new field 'Test Text Field', field addition to template works with field count updates visible in template cards. 2) /overview - Loads templates correctly with search functionality working, template cards show proper field counts and statistics (2 templates, 1 field total). 3) /enhanced-builder - All 3 tabs render properly (🛠️ Builder, 🧪 Simulator, 📎 Abhängigkeiten), template selection functional, sections render without errors. 4) /simulator - Role selector defaults to 'Anmelder', template selection works via checkboxes, simulation starts and renders results section properly. 5) /changelog - Displays 16 changelog entries with proper formatting, shows create/update entries from test scenarios, statistics show activity breakdown. All API calls use correct REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL with /api prefix. No console errors or network failures detected. Screenshots captured for all scenarios. Frontend-C# backend integration working perfectly with full CRUD functionality.

  Run a persistence validation against C# backend:
  1) Create template A and field X via API
  2) Associate field X to template A via PUT
  3) GET /api/templates and /api/templates/{id} to ensure the association is present
  4) Create template B and field Y, then repeat association
  5) Restart csharp-backend service (supervisor) then GET templates again to confirm persistence in SQLite
  Report any inconsistencies.

      ✅ C# Backend SQLite persistence validation completed successfully! Comprehensive test executed as requested: Created templates A & B with fields X & Y, associated them via PUT APIs, verified associations via GET APIs, restarted csharp-backend service via supervisor, and confirmed all data persisted correctly in SQLite database. All 13 test steps passed with 100% success rate. No inconsistencies detected. The C# ASP.NET Core backend with SQLite database demonstrates perfect data persistence across service restarts. Template-field associations, multilingual content, and all metadata remain intact after restart.

  Run UI test for Export in Template Builder:
  1) Navigate to /builder, wait data
  2) If no templates, create one (DE name only minimal). Select it
  3) Click 'Export JSON' button
  4) Verify a download is triggered with filename starting 'template-' and JSON content has id, name.de
  5) Report any errors

        comment: "❌ CRITICAL: Export JSON functionality fails due to missing backend endpoint. Frontend implementation is correct: 1) ✅ Navigation to /builder works - page loads with 'Schablonen-Builder' title. 2) ✅ Template selection works - 'Test Schablone' template found and selectable with blue border indication. 3) ✅ Export JSON button found and clickable in top right corner. 4) ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE: Backend API endpoint /api/templates/{id}/export returns 404 Not Found. The frontend correctly calls the export API but the Python backend (currently running on port 8001) does not implement the export endpoint. The C# backend has export functionality implemented but cannot start due to port conflict with Python backend. Error: 'Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404' when clicking Export JSON button. No download is triggered due to API failure."

      ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Export JSON functionality in Template Builder fails due to missing backend API endpoint. Frontend UI works perfectly (navigation, template selection, button click), but the Python backend lacks the /api/templates/{id}/export endpoint that returns 404. The C# backend has this functionality implemented but cannot run due to port conflict. This is a high-priority backend implementation issue that blocks the export feature completely. Main agent needs to either: 1) Implement the export endpoint in the Python backend, or 2) Switch to the C# backend by stopping the Python backend first.
